Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person(given = "Michal",

Description: Construct matching estimators, and optimal linear estimators, along
    with confidence intervals for conditional average treatment effects under
    unconfoundedness that are valid in finite samples under the assumption that
    the regression function satisfies a Lipschitz constraint.
