Title: Honest inference for treatment effects under unconfoudedness
Version: 0.0.2
Authors@R: 'Michal Kolesar <kolesarmi@googlemail.com> [aut, cre]'
Description: Constructs matching estimators, and optimal linear estimators, as
    well as confidence intervals for conditional average treatment effects under
    unconfoundedness that are valid in finite samples under the assumption that
    the regression function satisfies a Lipschitz constraint.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
