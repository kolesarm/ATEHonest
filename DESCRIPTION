Description: Construct matching estimators, and optimal linear estimators, along
    with confidence intervals for conditional and population average treatment
    effects under unconfoundedness that are valid in finite samples under the
    assumption that the regression function satisfies a Lipschitz constraint.
Depends: R (>= 4.0.0)
