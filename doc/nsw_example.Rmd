The package `ATEHonest` implements honest confidence intervals and estimators
for estimating average treatment effects under unconfoundedness from @ak17ate.
Here we illustrate the use of the package using NSW data from @DeWa99.

The data is shipped with the package, as two data frames, `NSW` (where the
treated units are from the experimental sample and control units are from PSID),
and `NSWexper`, where both treated and control units are from the experimental
sample. We'll use the experimental sample here.

First we extract the design matrix, and the treatment and outcome vectors:

```{r}
library("ATEHonest")
X <- as.matrix(NSWexper[, 2:10])
d <- NSWexper$treated
y <- NSWexper$re78
```

Next, we compute matrix of distances between treated and control units, using
the same weight matrix to compute distances as in @ak17ate:
```{r}
Ahalf <- diag(c(0.15, 0.6, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1))
D0 <- distMat(X, Ahalf, method="manhattan", d)
```

Next, construct a distance matrix used by the nearest neighbor variance
estimator to estimate the conditional variance of the outcome. We use
Mahalanobis distance:

```{r}
DM <- distMat(X, chol(solve(cov(X))), method="euclidean")
```

We are now ready to compute the root mean squared error optimal estimator:

```{r}
c1 <- ATTOptEstimate(y=y, d=d, D0=D0, C=1, DM=DM, opt.criterion="RMSE")
print(c1)
```

Next, we compute the estimator that's optimal for constructing two-sided CIs. We
re-use the solution path returned by `c1`:
```{r}
ATTOptEstimate(op=c1$op, C=1, DM=DM, opt.criterion="FLCI")
```

For computing efficiency of one- and two-sided CIs at smooth functions (see
Appendix A in @ak17ate), the solution path is not long enough:

```{r}
ATTEffBounds(c1$op, DM=DM, C=1)
```

We therefore make it longer, by passing the output `c1$op` as an argument to
`ATTOptPath` (at the moment, only the `ATTOptEstimate` can automatically compute
extra steps in the solution path as needed):

```{r}
op <- ATTOptPath(path=c1$op, maxsteps=290)
ATTEffBounds(op, DM=DM, C=1)
```

For comparison, we also consider matching estimators. First, a matching
estimator with a single match:
```{r}
ATTMatchEstimate(ATTMatchPath(y, d, D0, M=1, tol=1e-12), C=1, DM=DM)
```

Next, we optimize the number of matches. For that we first compute the matching
estimator for a vector of matches `M`, and then optimize the number of matches
using `ATTMatchEstmate`:
```{r}
mp <- ATTMatchPath(y, d, D0, M=1:10, tol=1e-12)
ATTMatchEstimate(mp, C=1, DM=DM, opt.criterion="FLCI")
ATTMatchEstimate(mp, C=1, DM=DM, opt.criterion="RMSE")
```

We can see that a single match is in fact optimal for both estimation and
construction of two-sided CIs.

```{r cleanup, include=FALSE}
options(oldoptions)
```
